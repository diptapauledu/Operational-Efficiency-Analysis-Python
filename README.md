Python-based operational efficiency analysis project
# Operational Efficiency Analysis Using Python

This project analyzes operational process data using Python to identify efficiency issues.
It focuses on defect rate calculation and processing time analysis to support data-driven
decision-making in operations and engineering management.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Key Objectives
- Analyze operational efficiency
- Calculate defect rates
- Visualize performance trends
- Identify improvement opportunities

This project is part of my learning journey in Six Sigma, operations analysis,
and engineering management.
